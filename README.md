# OwnProfileManager
A cross-platform Electron app for managing and securing personal data

# Electron Profile Manager

This project is an Electron-based application designed to manage a comprehensive personal profile. It includes features like storing document images, account information, passwords, contact details, and more. The goal is to create a scalable, cross-platform, and secure application that can work offline with the option to synchronize data across devices.

## General Idea

The application is intended to provide a secure and user-friendly interface for managing personal data. It will support various features such as:

- **Document Management**: Store and view images of important documents securely.
- **Account Information**: Manage and encrypt bank accounts, passwords, and usernames.
- **Contact Management**: Maintain an address book with phone numbers and contact details.
- **Synchronization**: Optionally synchronize data with cloud services like Google or Apple for backup and access across devices.
- **Offline Functionality**: The app will be fully functional offline, with data stored locally on the device.

## Requirements

- **Node.js**: Version 14.x or later
- **npm**: Version 6.x or later (comes with Node.js)
- **Git**: Version control system
- **Electron**: Framework for building cross-platform desktop apps with web technologies

### Tools and Technologies

- **Electron**: Used to build the cross-platform desktop application.
- **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**: The primary IDE for development.
